"I am a passionate Interior Designer with a strong foundation in structural engineering. With 2 years of experience as a Site Engineer, I have worked on superstructures, including power plant foundations, silos, warehouses, and ready-mix plant foundations. Over the past 6 months, I have been working in interior design, specializing in planning, 3D visualization, and execution.

I excel in conceptualizing and designing functional spaces, leveraging CAD, 3ds Max + V-Ray, and site coordination to bring projects to life. My background in structural engineering allows me to seamlessly integrate technical precision with creative interior solutions, ensuring designs that are both aesthetic and structurally sound.
